#This file contains all the Flows for the BulkAction

#Below are the Flows to best tested Sections. Each Section represents one flow to be tested.
#Section Property Entity: EntityName as in EntityId.cfg & EntityIdMapping.cfg
#FromStatus: FromStatus value to be used in BulkAction. It is case-sensitive.
#ToStatus: ToStatus value to be used in BulkAction. It is case-sensitive.
#ExpectedResult: Possible Values are Success or Failure. Default Value is Success.
#Success Represents that the Status of the Entity should be updated from FromStatus to ToStatus successfully.
#Failure Represents that Status of the Entity should not be updated and the BulkAction should fail. This should be used to verify negative test cases

#NOTE: Provide only one status. Conjunctions like 'Or' are not allowed.
#For ex. If From Status On UI is 'Upcoming or Overdue' then provide either Upcoming or Overdue.
