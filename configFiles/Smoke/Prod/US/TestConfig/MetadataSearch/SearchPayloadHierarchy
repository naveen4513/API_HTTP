#MetaData Search Payload Hierarchy Configuration File.
#Here all the Payload Hierarchies are defined for any field which requires Special handling.
#NOTE: For all the Special Hierarchies, ShowFieldHierarchy should also be updated. (Data Validation Hierarchy would be same)

#All the Hierarchies are given a name are hard coded so must NOT be changed.
#Below hierarchies are for all the Fields that DO NOT belong to Types Stakeholders, Select.
#All the hierarchies defined below are taken care of in the code.
#Here key is the Hierarchy Name and the Value suggest the hierarchy layout.

[hierarchy]
default = values[text]
hierarchy1 = values[object] -> name[text]

#By Default, all the Fields are considered to have Default Payload Hierarchy defined by 'DefaultHierarchy'.
#If any field for an Entity requires any Special Payload Hierarchy then :
#Specify the Section as the Entity Name as defined in EntityId.cfg file and is case-sensitive. If the Hierarchy for a Field is same across multiple Entities then could define\
Field and its Hierarchy under Section named 'default'.
#The Key would be Field Name as in LayoutComponent Object.
#The value here would be the Hierarchy Name

#The Hierarchy Picking Preference Order is as follows:
#1. Hierarchy defined for a field under Section of Entity.
#2. Hierarchy defined for a field under Section 'default'.
#3. Default Hierarchy mentioned as in Section Hierarchy.

#NOTE: All the Keys are Case-Sensitive.
